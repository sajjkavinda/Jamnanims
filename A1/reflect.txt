- yesNo variable stores char values.

2. scanf("%6[^\n]%*c", name->middleInitial);
corrected:
	scanf("%4[^\n]%*c", name->middleInitial);
- places assigned to middleInitials is 5

3. if (yesNo == "y" || yesNo == "Y") {
corrected:
	if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y') {
- should use single quotation marks when check char values

4. if (yesNo == 'y' && yesNo == 'Y') {
corrected: 
	if (yesNo == 'y' || yesNo == 'Y') {
- should check 'OR' in the condition
